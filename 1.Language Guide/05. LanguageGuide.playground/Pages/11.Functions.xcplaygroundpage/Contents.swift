/**
 Functions are self-cotained chunks of code that perform a specifc task. You give a function a name that identifies what it does, and this name is used to 'call' the function to perform its task when needed.
 
 Swift's unified function syntax is flexible enough to express anything from a simple C-style function with no parameter names to a complex Objective-C-sytle method with naes and argument labels for each parameter.
